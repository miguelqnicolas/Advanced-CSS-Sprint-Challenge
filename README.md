## Self-Study Questions

1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

An adaptive will use percents and some units that scale, but it will not be fully responsive. A fully responsive website will use media queries and look great on mobile, tablet, or desktop view.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first?

Mobile first means to build a website in mobile view first and then scale up to a tablet and desktop width. Building a website desktop first is the opposite. You build the website in desktop view and then scale down to tablet and mobile view, adjusting things as you go.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?

The default font size in HTML is 16 pixels. 62.5% of that is 10 pixels. This makes the math with rem units very simple to calculate.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?

A preprocessor allows you to organize your CSS. You can create variables and functions essentially to automate your workload and make quick changes throughout the whole site.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?

My favorite concept is a parametric mix-in because it's like a function since it allows you to pass arguments through. A concept that give me a little trouble was the syntax in escaping, or storing a media query in a variable.
